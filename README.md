- Usage analytics
- Dashboard
- Social integration
- User Administration
- Cloud Code integration
- Multiple mobile platform SDKs

The real-time providers are marked with :zap: icon.

###List of providers

- **[AnyPresence](http://www.anypresence.com/solutions/mbaas/)**
The AnyPresence MBaaS is focused on simplifying the process of building enterprise mobile apps that run on many devices, without sacrificing developer flexibility. Users without much mobile experience or time can get started quickly, to assemble and deploy an app through a web-based designer. Advanced developers have access to the source code for all underlying components, to make customizations outside the platform or deploy server components on-premise.

- **[ApiOmat](https://apiomat.com)**
ApiOmat enables your enterprise processes to function as mobile applications. We mobilize complex business structures and processes by offering a mobile backend as a service solution that connects existing IT-systems with mobile applications and devices. The mobile backend as a service can be directly installed in a company’s data center, with connectors operating as a secure linkage to IT systems. This allows employees to work with data via apps and digital instances irrespective of where they are. 

- **[Backbeam](http://backbeam.io)** :zap:
Backbeam offers many services that you will use to build your web and mobile applications. Backbeam is also designed to help you in your development process, not only when your application is finished.

- **[Buddy](https://buddy.com)**
A lightweight, fast and flexible platform for collecting and processing IoT data.

- **[built.io](https://www.built.io/products/backend/overview)** :zap:
Built.io's award-winning mobile Backend-as-a-Service (mBaaS) allows companies to create applications without the hassle of designing, building, and maintaining a custom backend technology stack. Built.io Backend provides a proven, enterprise-grade platform that powers engaging applications for web, mobile and loT — built in weeks or days, instead of months.

- **[CloudMine](https://cloudmine.me)**
Data security & governance often hinders the delivery of mobile initiatives by presenting risks to organizations including privacy, authorization and auditability. Building compliant mobile systems requires expertise in constantly evolving regulations. These challenges make for a perfect storm of complexity within healthcare and highly regulated industries, leading to significant friction instead of innovation. CloudMine provides a turn-key compliance framework to manage this moving target.

- **[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com)** :zap:
A backend as a service that provides an API to both store and sync data in realtime across all your clients. When data changes, apps built with Firebase update instantly across every device - web or mobile. Firebase-powered apps also work offline, data is automatically synchronized when your app regains connectivity. With Firebase you don't need to write any backend code - or worry about scaling that backend.

- **[Helios](http://helios.io)**
An extensible open-source backend framework for iOS apps from Mattt Thompson. Helios is built on the Rack webserver interface and is comprised of a collection of backend components that you can mix and match to provide features including data synchronisation, push notifications, in-app purchases, Passbook, Newstand, logging and analytics.

- **[Kii](https://en.kii.com/platform)**
With Kii’s mobile backend, create scalable, high performance mobile apps for various operating systems that all connect with your device seamlessly. With a complete set of built-in development tools, reduce your app development time from months to hours.

- **[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com)**
An alternative backend-as-a-service provider very similar to Parse. Like Parse, it offers cloud storage, push notifications and custom business logic, but also provides an out-of-the-box implementation of Facebook Open Graph for apps that don't have websites.

- **[Kumulos](http://www.kumulos.com)**
The Kumulos platform started life back in 2010 as a mBaaS. It was built to make it easy and affordable for app developers to build, ship and maintain even the most complex and scalable apps. Since then we have dedicated ourselves to helping app businesses smooth their revenue streams and building services that deliver strong, reliable recurring revenues. Services that are easy to sell, are valued by app owners and keep you close to your customers.

- **[Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)**
A new certificate authority that's free, automated, and open. Let’s Encrypt aims to allow anyone who owns a domain (including this site) to use a trusted certificate to secure their server at zero cost unlike other CAs that may charge over $100 per year to do the same. It also includes a command line tool that runs on your web server that makes it painless to obtain a certificate, securely configure it for use, and automatically take care of renewal. Let's Encrypt is backed by some big sponsors, including Cisco, Mozilla and Facebook, and has just entered public beta so can now be used by everyone.

- **[Objective-Cloud](http://objective-cloud.com)**
Not exactly an iOS development tool, but it is an idea that is mad enough to get a mention. As the name suggests, Objective-Cloud allows you to run Objective-C in the cloud. You can develop your custom web applications in Xcode, deploy straight to the cloud and they handle all the scaling. They also provide an SDK that includes a custom HTTP handler for creating RESTful web services. Price tiers are very reasonable as well.

- **[Otto](https://www.ottoproject.io)**
A new devops tool that automates the way application environments are created for both development and production use. Created by HashiCorp, Otto aims to be the successor to Vagrant by abstracting away the complexity of learning all the tooling required to develop locally, provision infrastructure, deploy applications, and secure applications, into one tool to handle all the aspects of development and deployment to any cloud platform. A great tool for iOS developers that need to build a backend service but don't have to time to learn all the tooling required to develop and deploy.

- **[Perfect](http://perfect.org)**
A framework for developing web and other REST services in Swift. Perfect's primary focus is on facilitating mobile apps which require backend server software, allowing you to use one language for both client-side and server-side development. It consists of: PerfectLib, a module components and utilities for client and server including JSON encoding/decoding, cURL support, byte stream management, and more; Perfect Server, a backend server supporting FastCGI or stand-alone HTTP; and a set of connectors to add server side support for technologies such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

- **[StackShare](http://stackshare.io)**
A site where you can discover the tech stacks behind some of the world's best software companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox. StackShare lets you see which tools and services they use, and how they're using them. If you need to set up a backend service to support your iOS app but don't know what tools to use, StackShare is the best place to start. Once you're happy with the tools and services you've chosen, you can share your stack for other developers to discuss and vote on.

- **[Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/platform/backend-services)**
Telerik Backend Services (formerly known as “Everlive”) is another recent and feature-filled option. The backend storage is an object store, but you can create relationships between objects, upload files, store geospatial data (and query it comparatively to other locations for distance) and more. You can inject custom code — written in JavaScript – to be executed before or after items are created, read, updated or deleted. The user management features allow you to create users, assign roles, constrain permissions to resources and data, integrate with third parties like Facebook, Microsoft (LiveID) and Google or even your own corporate Active Directory. Telerik Backend Services support push notifications for iOS and Android, as well as email and SMS notifications. It’s worth noting that the management dashboard provides very easy-to-use tools to define schemas, manage users, create/edit data and test push notifications from within your browser. You also get usage analytics for database size, file storage, bandwidth used, push notifications and emails sent and HTTP requests.

- **[Urban Airship](https://www.urbanairship.com)**
Urban Airship used to just provide the backend for push notifications but has now expanded into other services such as analytics, audience segmentation and Passbook support. The SDK is simple to implement and the free plan includes 1 million push messages per month!
